## Development & testing
Local development is done with the help of [Web Dev Server](https://modern-web.dev/docs/dev-server/overview/) with the configuration defined in `web-dev-server-{env}.config.mjs` file. There are different configurations for different environment.

Testing relies on [Web Test Runner](https://modern-web.dev/docs/test-runner/overview/) with the configuration defined in `web-test-runner.config.mjs`. API hostname can be configured there.

## Scripts

Most scripts are in `npm run` commands.

- `start:local` runs your app for development reloading on file changes. spins up local [`json-server`](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) and feeds data defined in `fake-api/data.json`.
- `start:k8s` runs you app for development fetching the data from external prod Testgrid instance.
- `start:build` runs your app after it has been built using the build command
- `build` builds your app and outputs it in your `dist` directory
- `test` runs your test suite with Web Test Runner
- `lint` runs the linter for your project

## Pulling from upstream

Upstream proto definitions can be generated by running `pb/bump-protos.sh`

## Tooling configs

For most of the tools, the configuration is in the `package.json` to reduce the amount of files in your project.

If you customize the configuration a lot, you can consider moving them to individual files.
