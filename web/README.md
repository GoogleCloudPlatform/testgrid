## Scripts

This repository uses yarn

- `yarn install` installs dependencies. Run this first.
- `yarn start` runs your app for development, reloading on file changes
- `yarn start:build` runs your app after it has been built using the build command
- `yarn build` builds your app and outputs it in your `dist` directory
- `yarn test` runs your test suite with Web Test Runner
- `yarn storybook` opens the storybook component debugger
- `yarn lint` runs the linter for your project

For most of these tools, the configuration is in the `package.json` to reduce the amount of files in your project.
