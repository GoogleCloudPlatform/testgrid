## Development & testing
Local development is done with the help of [Web Dev Server](https://modern-web.dev/docs/dev-server/overview/) with the configuration defined in `web-dev-server.config.mjs` file. Config can be changed to fetch data from different APIs (fake or production) by replacing `process.env.API_HOST` variable.

Testing relies on [Web Test Runner](https://modern-web.dev/docs/test-runner/overview/) with the configuration defined in `web-test-runner.config.mjs`. API hostname can be configured there.

## Scripts

Most scripts are in `npm run` commands.

- `start` runs your app for development, reloading on file changes
- `start:build` runs your app after it has been built using the build command
- `build` builds your app and outputs it in your `dist` directory
- `test` runs your test suite with Web Test Runner
- `lint` runs the linter for your project

## Pulling from upstream

Upstream proto definitions can be generated by running `pb/bump-protos.sh`

## Tooling configs

For most of the tools, the configuration is in the `package.json` to reduce the amount of files in your project.

If you customize the configuration a lot, you can consider moving them to individual files.
