## TestGrid UI

[![Built with open-wc recommendations](https://img.shields.io/badge/built%20with-open--wc-blue.svg)](https://github.com/open-wc)

Testgrid frontend code uses Lit elements and is written in Typescript. `tsconfig.json` specifies where and how the Typescript will be compiled to Javascript.
More info about Lit and Typescript can be found in [Lit docs](https://lit.dev/) and [TS docs](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) respectively.

## Development
Local development is done with the help of [Web Dev Server](https://modern-web.dev/docs/dev-server/overview/). Web dev server configurations are defined in `web-dev-server-{env}.config.mjs` file. Depending on the config, frontend will render from the data from either fake or prod API. 

To see fake data, run `npm run start:local`. To see prod data, run `npm run start:k8s`. More info in the [Scripts](#scripts) section below.

## Testing
Testing relies on [Web Test Runner](https://modern-web.dev/docs/test-runner/overview/) with the configuration defined in `web-test-runner.config.mjs`. Testing is currently happening across the fake data provided by `json-server`.

To run the tests, run `npm run test`. More info in the [Scripts](#scripts) section below.

## Scripts

Most scripts are in `npm run` commands.

- `start:k8s` runs your app for development, reloading on file changes. Fetches the data from external k8s Testgrid API instance - actual data.
- `start:local` runs your app for development, reloading on file changes. Spins up a local `json-server` which serves the data from `src/fake-api/data.json` file, which is then rendered in frontend.
- `start:build` runs your app after it has been built using the build command
- `build` builds your app and outputs it in your `dist` directory
- `test` runs your test suite with Web Test Runner. Relies on the fake data provided by `json-server`.
- `lint` runs the linter for your project
