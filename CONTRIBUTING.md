# How to Contribute

*NOTE*: While we're in the process of open-sourcing, things will be changing
quickly in this repo. To avoid frustration, open an issue with a quick
description of the change you want to make, and we'll let you know if
anything in the works will interfere!

We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project. There are
just a few small guidelines you need to follow.

## Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License
Agreement. You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your contribution;
this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as
part of the project. Head over to <https://cla.developers.google.com/> to see
your current agreements on file or to sign a new one.

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one
(even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it
again.

## Code reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult
[GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more
information on using pull requests.

Guidelines](https://opensource.google.com/conduct/).

## Source Code Headers

Every file containing source code must include copyright and license
information. This includes any JS/CSS files that you might be serving out to
